# Shanikwa Haynes - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Shanikwa! I have an analytical background in data analytics and am currently on track to complete my degree in data analytics (Bachelor of Science. Data Analytics). I have developed a strong foundation in data analytics and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analytics as an entry-level data analyst. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV in [pdf](https://github.com/shanikwah/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Shanikwa%20H%20CV.pdf).

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects, and track my progress in topics related to data analytics / data science.
