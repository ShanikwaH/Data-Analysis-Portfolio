# Shanikwa Haynes - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Shanikwa! I have an analytical background in data analytics and am currently on track to complete my degree in computer science (Bachelor of Science. Computer Science). I have developed a strong foundation in data analytics and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analytics as an entry-level data analyst. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV in [pdf](https://github.com/ShanikwaH/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Shanikwa%20Haynes%20CV.pdf).

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects, and track my progress in topics related to data analytics / data science.

## Data Analytics Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Netflix Analytics
**Code:** [`Netflix Analytics`](https://github.com/ShanikwaH/SQL/blob/main/Netflix%20Analytics%20(DB-Fiddle))

**Goal:**  This project reveals insights about TV and Movie content hosted on Netflix. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning, and preprocessing.

**Description:** Utilizing a database schema in a fiddle environment, this project simulates Netflix analytics by structuring tables for user profiles, viewing history, and content details. 

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis.

**Technology:** DB Fiddle, PostgreSQL

**Results:** SQL functions that calculated and visually presented the TV and Movie content hosted on Netflix. Additionally, the TV and Movie content hosted on Netflix were analyzed and provided as insights.

### Telecom Sales
**Code:** [`Telecom Sales Dashboard`](https://github.com/ShanikwaH/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Telecom-data.xlsx)

**Goal:**  This project reveals insights about differences between people on contracts versus month-to-month customers. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning, and preprocessing.

**Description:** Utilized Excel to analyze sales by contracts of streaming movies that do not stream movies, have no internet service, and do stream movies for average tenure and average monthly charges. Analysis supports recommendations for differences between people on contracts versus month-to-month customers to increase company sales.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis.

**Technology:** Excel, Pivot Tables

**Results:** The project showcases valuable insights into the differences between customers on contracts and those on month-to-month subscriptions. By understanding these differences, telecom companies can tailor their marketing strategies, pricing plans, and service offerings to better cater to the needs and preferences of each customer segment, ultimately leading to increased sales and improved customer satisfaction.

### World Happiness Report

**Goal:** Dived deep into global happiness data, unraveling correlations between socio-economic elements and happiness indices.

**Code:** [`World Happiness Report`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shanikwa.haynes/viz/WorldHappinessReport_17125332623770/WorldHappinessReport)

**Description:** Dived deep into global happiness data, unraveling correlations between socio-economic elements and happiness indices. Applied SQL and Excel in data refinement, followed by crafting an engaging Tableau visualization. Authored a detailed report on the nexus between economic security and happiness levels. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning EDA (exploratory data analysis), and analyzing the correlation between economic security and happiness levels.[Image] ([https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shanikwa.haynes/viz/WorldHappinessReport_17125332623770/WorldHappinessReport])

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, data visualization.

**Technology:** SQL, Excel, Tableau

**Results:** Based on the analysis, I recommend prioritizing policies that address socio-economic inequalities and promote social cohesion to enhance overall happiness levels.
